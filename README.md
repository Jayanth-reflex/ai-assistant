## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **Python 3.8+** - Required for Whisper STT
- **Gemini API Key** - Free from Google AI Studio

### Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key (starts with `AIza...`)
5. Keep this key secure - you'll need it for setup

### Step 2: Clone and Install

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-meetings-assistant.git
cd ai-meetings-assistant

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Install Python dependencies for Whisper
pip3 install openai-whisper torch
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root:
```bash
touch .env
```

2. Add your Gemini API key to the `.env` file:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. It's already included in `.gitignore`.

### Step 4: Install Whisper (Speech-to-Text)

#### macOS
```bash
# Install Python if not already installed
brew install python

# Install Whisper and PyTorch
pip3 install openai-whisper torch

# Verify installation
python3 -c "import whisper; print('Whisper installed successfully')"
```

#### Windows
```bash
# Download Python from python.org and add to PATH
# Then install Whisper
pip install openai-whisper torch

# Verify installation
python -c "import whisper; print('Whisper installed successfully')"
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Development Mode (Recommended for first run)

```bash
# Start the development server and Electron app
npm run app:dev
```

This command will:
- Start the Vite development server on port 5180
- Launch the Electron application
- Enable hot reloading for development

### Production Build

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# The built app will be in the release/ folder
```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + B` | Toggle window visibility |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + H` | Take screenshot and analyze |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Get AI solution/assistance |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + R` | Reset/clear current session |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Arrow Keys` | Move window position |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Q` | Quit application |

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App won't start:**
```bash
# Kill existing processes on port 5180
lsof -i :5180
kill -9 [PID]

# Clear npm cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

**Whisper not working:**
```bash
# Reinstall Whisper
pip3 uninstall openai-whisper
pip3 install openai-whisper torch

# Test installation
python3 -c "import whisper; model = whisper.load_model('base'); print('OK')"
```

**API Key issues:**
- Verify your `.env` file exists and contains the correct API key
- Check that the API key starts with `AIza`
- Ensure you have sufficient Gemini API quota

### Performance Optimization

- **GPU Acceleration**: Install CUDA for faster Whisper processing (optional)
- **Memory Usage**: Close other applications if experiencing slowdowns
- **Storage**: Ensure adequate disk space for session data
