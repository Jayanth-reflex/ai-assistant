# AI Interview Assistant - Future Development Plan

> Comprehensive optimization plan for the AI Interview Assistant focusing on performance, security, and local data storage.

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a detailed optimization strategy to transform the AI Interview Assistant into a high-performance, secure, and user-friendly application. The plan emphasizes local data storage (up to 24 hours), elimination of unnecessary caching, and comprehensive performance improvements across all system components.

## 1. Data Storage & Lifecycle

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Screenshots | Saved permanently in /Library/Application Support/ | Store in memory buffer, only write to disk if >10MB or user explicitly saves | Auto-delete after 24h, scan on startup for orphaned files |
| Audio Files | Saved as temp files in /tmp/ai-interview-assistant/ | Process directly from memory buffer, no disk I/O unless buffer >50MB | Immediate cleanup after transcription, fallback to disk if memory full |
| Text Input | Saved as temp files in /tmp/ai-interview-assistant/ | Process directly from string buffer, no file creation | No disk storage needed, immediate cleanup |
| Cache Data | 30min TTL, stored in memory + disk | In-memory only, 5min TTL, no disk persistence | Purge on app start, LRU eviction when memory >100MB |
| Optimized Images | Saved as new files in temp directory | Process in memory, stream directly to API | Auto-cleanup after API call, no temp file creation |

## 2. Processing Pipeline

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Image Processing | Read file → Optimize → Write file → Read file → API | Buffer → Compress in memory → Stream to API | Fallback to disk if image >50MB, retry on compression failure |
| Audio Processing | Save file → Python subprocess → Read result | Buffer → Direct API call (no Python subprocess) | Fallback to Whisper if direct API fails, retry 3 times |
| Text Processing | Save file → Read file → Process | Direct string processing, no I/O | No failure points, immediate processing |
| API Calls | Sequential processing, 3 concurrent max | Parallel processing, 5 concurrent, request batching | Rate limit handling, exponential backoff, user cancellation |
| Response Handling | Wait for complete response | Stream partial results, progressive display | Show partial results on timeout, retry background |

## 3. Concurrency & Queue Management

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Request Queue | Static 3 concurrent, FIFO | Dynamic 5-10 concurrent, priority-based (user > background) | Pause queue if system load >80%, user notification |
| Processing Order | Sequential by queue order | Parallel processing, user requests prioritized | Cancel background tasks if user request comes in |
| Rate Limiting | 10 requests/second | Adaptive: 15-20 req/sec when system idle, 5 req/sec when busy | Auto-throttle on API errors, user override option |
| Deduplication | None - same file processed multiple times | Hash-based deduplication, wait for existing result | Timeout after 30s if duplicate request stuck |

## 4. Memory Management

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Memory Usage | Uncontrolled growth, LRU cache | Strict 200MB limit, aggressive cleanup | Force cleanup at 150MB, pause processing at 180MB |
| Buffer Management | Fixed buffer sizes | Dynamic buffers based on content size | Fallback to disk if buffer >100MB, user notification |
| Cache Eviction | LRU with 30min TTL | Immediate eviction after use, 5min TTL max | Force eviction on memory pressure, no persistence |
| Resource Cleanup | Manual cleanup, 24h TTL | Immediate cleanup, scheduled every 5 minutes | Crash recovery on startup, orphaned file detection |

## 5. Error Handling & Recovery

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Network Errors | Basic retry, user sees generic error | Smart retry with exponential backoff, specific error messages | Fallback to offline mode, queue requests for later |
| API Failures | 2 retries, then fail | 5 retries with different strategies, partial result display | Show cached results if available, user retry option |
| File System Errors | Crash or hang | Graceful degradation, memory-only mode | Auto-recovery, user notification of limited functionality |
| Memory Exhaustion | App crash | Proactive memory management, user warnings | Force cleanup, pause new processing, user guidance |
| Process Crashes | Manual restart required | Auto-restart with state recovery | State persistence, resume from last checkpoint |

## 6. User Experience & Feedback

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Progress Indication | Basic loading states | Real-time progress bars, streaming text display | Always show status, estimated time remaining |
| Error Messages | Generic error messages | Specific, actionable error messages with solutions | Provide retry options, alternative approaches |
| Response Time | 2-5 seconds typical | 0.5-2 seconds typical, instant for cached results | Show partial results immediately, background completion |
| Cancellation | Limited cancellation options | Cancel any operation, reprioritize tasks | Immediate cancellation, cleanup of partial work |
| Performance Monitor | Manual toggle (Ctrl+Shift+P) | Always visible mini-indicator, expandable details | Auto-show on performance issues, proactive alerts |

## 7. Security & Privacy

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Data Persistence | Files stored up to 24h | No persistence beyond processing, immediate deletion | Secure deletion, no recovery possible |
| Memory Security | Plain text in memory | Encrypted memory buffers, secure cleanup | Memory wiping on app close, no swap file usage |
| API Security | Basic API key storage | Secure API key handling, request signing | API key rotation, secure storage |
| Crash Security | Orphaned files possible | No file creation unless absolutely necessary | Secure deletion on startup, no data leakage |

## 8. Performance Metrics & Monitoring

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Response Time | 2-5 seconds | Target: 0.5-2 seconds | Alert if >3 seconds, show progress |
| Memory Usage | Unmonitored | Real-time monitoring, proactive management | Auto-cleanup at thresholds, user warnings |
| Cache Hit Rate | 60-80% | Target: 80-95% | Cache warming, intelligent prefetching |
| Error Rate | Not tracked | Comprehensive error tracking, user feedback | Auto-retry, graceful degradation |
| System Load | Not monitored | Real-time system load monitoring | Auto-throttle, user notification |

## 9. Cleanup & Maintenance

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| File Cleanup | 24h TTL, manual possible | Immediate cleanup, scheduled every 5 minutes | Startup scan, orphaned file detection |
| Memory Cleanup | LRU eviction | Immediate cleanup after use, proactive management | Force cleanup on memory pressure |
| Cache Cleanup | 30min TTL | 5min TTL, immediate eviction | Purge on startup, no persistence |
| Session Cleanup | Manual (Cmd+R) | Automatic on app close, session timeout | Force cleanup on crash recovery |

## 10. Scalability & Future-Proofing

| Component | Present Situation | Optimization Strategy | Fail-Safe Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Concurrent Users | Single user | Multi-user ready architecture | Resource isolation, user quotas |
| File Size Limits | No limits | Smart limits based on system resources | Graceful degradation, user guidance |
| API Rate Limits | Static 10 req/sec | Dynamic rate limiting, API quota management | Queue management, user notification |
